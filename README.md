What is Ultimate?
----------------

The emergence of blockchain-based decentralized digital currencies woke up hopes for the beginning of a better world. A world, where wealth is distributed fairly without control and influence of a powerful middleman. Although blockchain technology equipped us with a perfect tool to make this dream come true, it will not happen by itself.

The concept of a socially responsible cryptocurrency inspired us to create Ultima - a platform designed to support endeavors of its community in various areas. The Ultimate Multi-Module Platform (MMP) includes functionalities ranging from a digital marketplace to crowdfunding and charity components. By working together on noble causes we will regain the faith in cryptocurrencies.
